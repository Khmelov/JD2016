English is either the official language or an official language in almost 60 sovereign states.
It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland and it
is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language
in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and is an official language
of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations.
English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian
dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the fifth century, are called Old English.
