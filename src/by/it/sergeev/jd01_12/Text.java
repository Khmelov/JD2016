                "Indeed, the best place to be in summer is the beach. That’s exactly where my family and I go every year during the summer holiday. Luckily, we live rather close to the seaside. It takes about four hours by car to get to the Black Sea. Some of our relatives live in Anapa, so we can stay at their place. Every day we go to the central beach to swim, sunbathe, play outdoor games and just relax. Sometimes we go sightseeing or to the concert. There is a large concert hall right at the seafront. There are also some water slides, so we are always ready to have fun. Time flies in Anapa. I beg my parents to stay a little longer, but their holidays are not as long as mine.\n" +
                "When we return home, they proceed to work and I go to my grandparents’ place. They live in a quiet countryside near the lake. At least I can swim and ride a bike there. I also have some good friends in their area, so I don’t get bored at all. We play volleyball or badminton, run a race, listen to music, go for a walk together. Sometimes, after the rain we go to the forest to pick mushrooms. My grandmother then cooks delicious meals with them. My grandfather often goes fishing and I can accompany him whenever I want. In conclusion, I’d like to say that summer can never be boring. There are plenty of interesting and pleasant things to do at this time of the year.";
