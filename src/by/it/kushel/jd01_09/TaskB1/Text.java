            "hate coming home when it was almost dark, with ice-cold fingers and toes, feeling miserable because\n" +
            "Bessie, the nursemaid, was always scolding me. All the time I knew I was different from my cousins,\n" +
            "Eliza, John and Georgiana Reed.\n" +
            "They were taller and stronger than me, and they were loved.\n" +
            "These three usually spent their time crying and quarrelling, but today they were sitting quietly\n" +
            "around their mother in the sitting-room. I wanted to join the family circle, but Mrs. Reed, my aunt,\n" +
            "refused. Bessie had complained about me.\n" +

            "'What does Bessie say I have done?' I asked.\n" +
            "'Jane, it is not polite to question me in that way. If you cannot speak pleasantly, be quiet.'\n" +
            "I crept out of the sitting-room and into the small room next door, where I chose a book full of\n" +
            "pictures from the bookcase. I climbed on to the window-seat and drew the curtains, so that I was\n" +
            "completely hidden. I sat there for a while. Sometimes I looked out of the window at the grey\n" +
            "November afternoon, and saw the rain pouring down on the leafless garden. But most of the time I\n" +
            "studied the book and stared, fascinated, at the pictures. Lost in the world of imagination, I forgot my\n" +
            "sad, lonely existence for a while, and was happy. I was only afraid that my secret hiding-place might\n" +
            "be discovered.\n" +
            "Suddenly the door of the room opened. John Reed rushed in.\n" +
            "'Where are you, rat?' he shouted. He did not see me behind the curtain. 'Eliza! Georgy! Jane\n" +
            "isn't here! Tell Mamma she's run out into the rain â€“ what a bad animal she is!'\n" +
            "'How lucky I drew the curtain,' I thought. He would never have found me, because he was not\n" +
            "very intelligent. But Eliza guessed at once where I was.\n" +
            "'She's in the window-seat, John,' she called\n" +
            "from the sitting-room. So I came out\n" +

            "'What do you want?' I asked him.\n" +

            "John Reed was fourteen and I was only ten.\n" +
            "He was large and rather fat. He usually ate\n" +
            "too much at meals, which made him ill. He\n" +
            "should have been at boarding school, but his\n" +
            "mother, who loved him very much, had\n" +
            "brought him home for a month or two,\n" +
            "because she thought his health was delicate.\n" +
            "John did not love his mother or his sisters,\n" +
            "and he hated me. He bullied and punished\n" +
            "me, not two or three times a week, not once\n" +
            "or twice a day, but all the time. My whole\n" +
            "body trembled when he came near.\n" +
            "Sometimes he hit me, sometimes he just\n" +
            "threatened me, and I lived in terrible fear of\n" +
            "him. I had no idea how to stop him. The\n" +
            "servants did not want to offend their young master, and Mrs. Reed could see no fault in her dear boy.\n" +
            "So I obeyed John's order and approached his armchair, thinking how very ugly his face was.\n" +
            "Perhaps he understood what I was thinking, for he hit me hard on the face.\n" +
            "'That is for your rudeness to Mamma just now,' he said, 'and for your wickedness in hiding, and\n" +
            "for looking at me like that, you rat!'\n" +
            "I was so used to his bullying that I never thought of hitting him back.\n" +
